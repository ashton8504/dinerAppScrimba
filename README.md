Diner App
This project is a fully responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Diner App mimics an online food ordering system and incorporates various concepts and techniques.

Technologies Used
HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the web pages.
CSS: Used for styling the elements and designing the visual appearance of the app.
JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity and functionality to the app.
Key Learnings
Text Area: Utilized the <textarea> element to provide a multi-line input field for user comments or additional information.

Array Iteration: Employed the .forEach() method to iterate over arrays and perform operations on each element.

Data Attributes: Leveraged data attributes to store custom data within HTML elements, allowing for dynamic data manipulation and retrieval in JavaScript.

Conditional Rendering of Styles: Implemented conditional statements to dynamically apply different styles to elements based on specific conditions or user interactions.

Logical NOT Operator: Utilized the logical NOT (!) operator to invert boolean values or conditions.

CDNs: Utilized Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to include external libraries or frameworks, such as fonts or icon sets, in the project.

Responsive Design
The Diner App is designed to be fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. It seamlessly transitions from desktop to mobile devices, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.

Application Overview
The Diner App is an online food ordering system that allows users to browse through a menu, view item details, add items to their order, and complete the ordering process. It provides an intuitive interface for users to select their desired items and customize their orders as needed.

The app incorporates modern design principles, including a clean and visually appealing layout, intuitive navigation, and user-friendly interactions. It aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for users looking to order food online.

Conclusion
Through the development of the Diner App, I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to utilize various HTML elements, apply styles using CSS, and add interactivity and functionality using JavaScript. The project allowed me to explore important concepts, such as array iteration, data attributes, conditional rendering of styles, and responsive design.

By completing this project, I have enhanced my web development skills and gained valuable insights into creating interactive and responsive web applications. I am now better equipped to tackle similar projects and continue growing as a web developer.
